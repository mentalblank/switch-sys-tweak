        ‚ö†Ô∏è **STOP. READ BEFORE CONTINUING.**

        This repository **does not** maintain the [`sys-tweak`](https://github.com/p-sam/switch-sys-tweak) source code.
        It only builds and packages sys-tweak using specific build flags (`FEAT_NSAM_CONTROL`, `FEAT_NSRO_CONTROL`) for easy drag-and-drop installation and updates.

        ‚ùå If your issue is about:
        - Crashes
        - Missing features
        - Bugs in how the program behaves
        - Requests for code changes

        üëâ **You are in the wrong place.** Please open an issue in the source repo instead: [`p-sam/switch-sys-tweak`](https://github.com/p-sam/switch-sys-tweak)

        ‚úÖ You *should* use this issue form if:
        - Something is missing from the release package
        - Files are in the wrong place
        - The ZIP release is broken or incomplete
        - Something in the setup or instructions is clearly incorrect

        We reserve the right to close irrelevant issues without reply. Thank you for understanding.
